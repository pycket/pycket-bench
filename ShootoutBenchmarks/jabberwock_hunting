he
sought

rested
he
by

he
stood
the

he
chortled
in
his
joy
twas
brillig
and
the
slithy

did

and
gimble
in
the
wabe
all
mimsy
were
the
borogoves
and
the
mome
raths
outgrabe
just
the
place
for
a
snark
the
bellman
cried
as
he
landed
his
crew
with
care
supporting
each
man
on
the
top
of
the
tide
by
a
finger
entwined
in
his
hair
just
the
place
for
a
snark
i
have
said
it
twice
that
alone
should
encourage
the
crew
just
the
place
for
a
snark
i
have
said
it
thrice
what
i
tell
you
three
times
is
true
the
crew
was
complete
it
included
a
boots
a
maker
of
bonnets
and
hoods
a
barrister
brought
to
arrange
their
disputes
and
a
broker
to
value
their
goods
a
billiard
marker
whose
skill
was
immense
might
perhaps
have
won
more
than
his
share
but
a
banker
engaged
at
enormous
expense
had
the
whole
of
their
cash
in
his
care
there
was
also
a
beaver
that
paced
on
the
deck
or
would
sit
making
lace
in
the
bow
and
had
often
the
bellman
said
saved
them
from
wreck
though
none
of
the
sailors
knew
how
there
was
one
who
was
famed
for
the
number
of
things
he
forgot
when
he
entered
the
ship
his
umbrella
his
watch
all
his
jewels
and
rings
and
the
clothes
he
had
bought
for
the
trip
he
had
forty
two
boxes
all
carefully
packed
with
his
name
painted
clearly
on
each
but
since
he
omitted
to
mention
the
fact
they
were
all
left
behind
on
the
beach
the
loss
of
his
clothes
hardly
mattered
because
he
had
seven
coats
on
when
he
came
with
three
pair
of
boots
but
the
worst
of
it
was
he
had
wholly
forgotten
his
name
he
would
answer
to
hi
or
to
any
loud
cry
such
as
fry
me
or
fritter
my
wig
to
what
you
may
call
um
or
what
was
his
name
but
especially
thing
um
a
jig
while
for
those
who
preferred
a
more
forcible
word
he
had
different
names
from
these
his
intimate
friends
called
him
candle
ends
and
his
enemies
toasted
cheese
his
form
in
ungainly
his
intellect
small
so
the
bellman
would
often
remark
but
his
courage
is
perfect
and
that
after
all
is
the
thing
that
one
needs
with
a
snark
he
would
joke
with
haenas
returning
their
stare
with
an
impudent
wag
of
the
head
and
he
once
went
a
walk
paw
in
paw
with
a
bear
just
to
keep
up
its
spirits
he
said
he
came
as
a
baker
but
owned
when
too
late
and
it
drove
the
poor
bellman
half
mad
he
could
only
bake
bride
cake
for
which
i
may
state
no
materials
were
to
be
had
the
last
of
the
crew
needs
especial
remark
though
he
looked
an
incredible
dunce
he
had
just
one
idea
but
that
one
being
snark
the
good
bellman
engaged
him
at
once
he
came
as
a
butcher
but
gravely
declared
when
the
ship
had
been
sailing
a
week
he
could
only
kill
beavers
the
bellman
looked
scared
and
was
almost
too
frightened
to
speak
but
at
length
he
explained
in
a
tremulous
tone
there
was
only
one
beaver
on
board
and
that
was
a
tame
one
he
had
of
his
own
whose
death
would
be
deeply
deplored
the
beaver
who
happened
to
hear
the
remark
protested
with
tears
in
its
eyes
that
not
even
the
rapture
of
hunting
the
snark
could
atone
for
that
dismal
surprise
it
strongly
advised
that
the
butcher
should
be
conveyed
in
a
separate
ship
but
the
bellman
declared
that
would
never
agree
with
the
plans
he
had
made
for
the
trip
navigation
was
always
a
difficult
art
though
with
only
one
ship
and
one
bell
and
he
feared
he
must
really
decline
for
his
part
undertaking
another
as
well
the
beavers
best
course
was
no
doubt
to
procure
a
second
hand
dagger
proof
coat
so
the
baker
advised
it
and
next
to
insure
its
life
in
some
office
of
note
this
the
banker
suggested
and
offered
for
hire
on
moderate
terms
or
for
sale
two
excellent
policies
one
against
fire
and
one
against
damage
from
hail
yet
still
ever
after
that
sorrowful
day
whenever
the
butcher
was
by
the
beaver
kept
looking
the
opposite
way
and
appeared
unaccountably
shy
fit
the
second
the
bellmans
speech
the
bellman
himself
they
all
praised
to
the
skies
such
a
carriage
such
ease
and
such
grace
such
solemnity
too
one
could
see
he
was
wise
the
moment
one
looked
in
his
face
he
had
bought
a
large
map
representing
the
sea
without
the
least
vestige
of
land
and
the
crew
were
much
pleased
when
they
found
it
to
be
a
map
they
could
all
understand
whats
the
good
of
mercators
north
poles
and
equators
tropics
zones
and
meridian
lines
so
the
bellman
would
cry
and
the
crew
would
reply
they
are
merely
conventional
signs
other
maps
are
such
shapes
with
their
islands
and
capes
but
weve
got
our
brave
captain
to
thank
so
the
crew
would
protest
that
hes
bought
us
the
best
a
perfect
and
absolute
blank
this
was
charming
no
doubt
but
they
shortly
found
out
that
the
captain
they
trusted
so
well
had
only
one
notion
for
crossing
the
ocean
and
that
was
to
tingle
his
bell
he
was
thoughtful
and
grave
but
the
orders
he
gave
were
enough
to
bewilder
a
crew
when
he
cried
steer
to
starboard
but
keep
her
head
larboard
what
on
earth
was
the
helmsman
to
do
then
the
bowsprit
got
mixed
with
the
rudder
sometimes
a
thing
as
the
bellman
remarked
that
frequently
happens
in
tropical
climes
when
a
vessel
is
so
to
speak
snarked
but
the
principal
failing
occurred
in
the
sailing
and
the
bellman
perplexed
and
distressed
said
he
had
hoped
at
least
when
the
wind
blew
due
east
that
the
ship
would
not
travel
due
west
but
the
danger
was
past
they
had
landed
at
last
with
their
boxes
portmanteaus
and
bags
yet
at
first
sight
the
crew
were
not
pleased
with
the
view
which
consisted
to
chasms
and
crags
the
bellman
perceived
that
their
spirits
were
low
and
repeated
in
musical
tone
some
jokes
he
had
kept
for
a
season
of
woe
but
the
crew
would
do
nothing
but
groan
he
served
out
some
grog
with
a
liberal
hand
and
bade
them
sit
down
on
the
beach
and
they
could
not
but
own
that
their
captain
looked
grand
as
he
stood
and
delivered
his
speech
friends
romans
and
countrymen
lend
me
your
ears
they
were
all
of
them
fond
of
quotations
so
they
drank
to
his
health
and
they
gave
him
three
cheers
while
he
served
out
additional
rations
we
have
sailed
many
months
we
have
sailed
many
weeks
four
weeks
to
the
month
you
may
mark
but
never
as
yet
tis
your
captain
who
speaks
have
we
caught
the
least
glimpse
of
a
snark
we
have
sailed
many
weeks
we
have
sailed
many
days
seven
days
to
the
week
i
allow
but
a
snark
on
the
which
we
might
lovingly
gaze
we
have
never
beheld
till
now
come
listen
my
men
while
i
tell
you
again
the
five
unmistakable
marks
by
which
you
may
know
wheresoever
you
go
the
warranted
genuine
snarks
let
us
take
them
in
order
the
first
is
the
taste
which
is
meagre
and
hollow
but
crisp
like
a
coat
that
is
rather
too
tight
in
the
waist
with
a
flavour
of
will
o
the
wisp
its
habit
of
getting
up
late
youll
agree
that
it
carries
too
far
when
i
say
that
it
frequently
breakfasts
at
five
oclock
tea
and
dines
on
the
following
day
the
third
is
its
slowness
in
taking
a
jest
should
you
happen
to
venture
on
one
it
will
sigh
like
a
thing
that
is
deeply
distressed
and
it
always
looks
grave
at
a
pun
the
fourth
is
its
fondness
for
bathing
machines
which
it
constantly
carries
about
and
believes
that
they
add
to
the
beauty
of
scenes
a
sentiment
open
to
doubt
the
fifth
is
ambition
it
next
will
be
right
to
describe
each
particular
batch
distinguishing
those
that
have
feathers
and
bite
from
those
that
have
whiskers
and
scratch
for
although
common
snarks
do
no
manner
of
harm
yet
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
say
some
are
boojums
the
bellman
broke
off
in
alarm
for
the
baker
had
fainted
away
fit
the
third
the
bakers
tale
they
roused
him
with
muffins
they
roused
him
with
ice
they
roused
him
with
mustard
and
cress
they
roused
him
with
jam
and
judicious
advice
they
set
him
conundrums
to
guess
when
at
length
he
sat
up
and
was
able
to
speak
his
sad
story
he
offered
to
tell
and
the
bellman
cried
silence
not
even
a
shriek
and
excitedly
tingled
his
bell
there
was
silence
supreme
not
a
shriek
not
a
scream
scarcely
even
a
howl
or
a
groan
as
the
man
they
called
ho
told
his
story
of
woe
in
an
antediluvian
tone
my
father
and
mother
were
honest
though
poor
skip
all
that
cried
the
bellman
in
haste
if
it
once
becomes
dark
theres
no
chance
of
a
snark
we
have
hardly
a
minute
to
waste
i
skip
forty
years
said
the
baker
in
tears
and
proceed
without
further
remark
to
the
day
when
you
took
me
aboard
of
your
ship
to
help
you
in
hunting
the
snark
a
dear
uncle
of
mine
after
whom
i
was
named
remarked
when
i
bade
him
farewell
oh
skip
your
dear
uncle
the
bellman
exclaimed
as
he
angrily
tingled
his
bell
he
remarked
to
me
then
said
that
mildest
of
men
if
your
snark
be
a
snark
that
is
right
fetch
it
home
by
all
means
you
may
serve
it
with
greens
and
its
handy
for
striking
a
light
you
may
seek
it
with
thimbles
and
seek
it
with
care
you
may
hunt
it
with
forks
and
hope
you
may
threaten
its
life
with
a
railway
share
you
may
charm
it
with
smiles
and
soap
thats
exactly
the
method
the
bellman
bold
in
a
hasty
parenthesis
cried
thats
exactly
the
way
i
have
always
been
told
that
the
capture
of
snarks
should
be
tried
but
oh
beamish
nephew
beware
of
the
day
if
your
snark
be
a
boojum
for
then
you
will
softly
and
suddenly
vanish
away
and
never
be
met
with
again

it
is
this
it
is
this
that
oppresses
my
soul
when
i
think
of
my
uncles
last
words
and
my
heart
is
like
nothing
so
much
as
a
bowl
brimming
over
with
quivering
curds
it
is
this
it
is
this
we
have
had
that
before
the
bellman
indignantly
said
and
the
baker
replied
let
me
say
it
once
more
it
is
this
it
is
this
that
i
dread
i
engage
with
the
snark
every
night
after
dark
in
a
dreamy
delirious
fight
i
serve
it
with
greens
in
those
shadowy
scenes
and
i
use
it
for
striking
a
light
but
if
ever
i
meet
with
a
boojum
that
day
in
a
moment
of
this
i
am
sure
i
shall
softly
and
suddenly
vanish
away
and
the
notion
i
cannot
endure
fit
the
fourth
the
hunting
the
bellman
looked
uffish
and
wrinkled
his
brow
if
only
youd
spoken
before
its
excessively
awkward
to
mention
it
now
with
the
snark
so
to
speak
at
the
door
we
should
all
of
us
grieve
as
you
well
may
believe
if
you
never
were
met
with
again
but
surely
my
man
when
the
voyage
began
you
might
have
suggested
it
then
its
excessively
awkward
to
mention
it
now
as
i
think
ive
already
remarked
and
the
man
they
called
hi
replied
with
a
sigh
i
informed
you
the
day
we
embarked
you
may
charge
me
with
murder
or
want
of
sense
we
are
all
of
us
weak
at
times
but
the
slightest
approach
to
a
false
pretence
was
never
among
my
crimes
i
said
it
in
hebrew
i
said
it
in
dutch
i
said
it
in
german
and
greek
but
i
wholly
forgot
and
it
vexes
me
much
that
english
is
what
you
speak
tis
a
pitiful
tale
said
the
bellman
whose
face
had
grown
longer
at
every
word
but
now
that
youve
stated
the
whole
of
your
case
more
debate
would
be
simply
absurd
the
rest
of
my
speech
he
explained
to
his
men
you
shall
hear
when
ive
leisure
to
speak
it
but
the
snark
is
at
hand
let
me
tell
you
again
tis
your
glorious
duty
to
seek
it
to
seek
it
with
thimbles
to
seek
it
with
care
to
pursue
it
with
forks
and
hope
to
threaten
its
life
with
a
railway
share
to
charm
it
with
smiles
and
soap
for
the
snarks
a
peculiar
creature
that
wont
be
caught
in
a
commonplace
way
do
all
that
you
know
and
try
all
that
you
dont
not
a
chance
must
be
wasted
to
day
for
england
expects
i
forbear
to
proceed
tis
a
maxim
tremendous
but
trite
and
youd
best
be
unpacking
the
things
that
you
need
to
rig
yourselves
out
for
the
fight
then
the
banker
endorsed
a
blank
check
which
he
crossed
and
changed
his
loose
silver
for
notes
the
baker
with
care
combed
his
whiskers
and
hair
and
shook
the
dust
out
of
his
coats
the
boots
and
the
broker
were
sharpening
a
spade
each
working
the
grindstone
in
turn
but
the
beaver
went
on
making
lace
and
displayed
no
interest
in
the
concern
though
the
barrister
tried
to
appeal
to
its
pride
and
vainly
proceeded
to
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
which
making
laces
had
been
proved
an
infringement
of
right
the
maker
of
bonnets
ferociously
planned
a
novel
arrangement
of
bows
while
the
billiard
marker
with
quivering
hand
was
chalking
the
tip
of
his
nose
but
the
butcher
turned
nervous
and
dressed
himself
fine
with
yellow
kid
gloves
and
a
ruff
said
he
felt
it
exactly
like
going
to
dine
which
the
bellman
declared
was
all
stuff
introduce
me
now
theres
a
good
fellow
he
said
if
we
happen
to
meet
it
together
and
the
bellman
sagaciously
nodding
his
head
said
that
must
depend
on
the
weather
the
beaver
went
simply
galumphing
about
at
seeing
the
butcher
so
shy
and
even
the
baker
though
stupid
and
stout
made
an
effort
to
wink
with
one
eye
be
a
man
said
the
bellman
in
wrath
as
he
heard
the
butcher
beginning
to
sob
should
we
meet
with
a
jubjub
that
desperate
bird
we
shall
need
all
our
strength
for
the
job
fit
the
fifth
the
beavers
lesson
they
sought
it
with
thimbles
they
sought
it
with
care
they
pursued
it
with
forks
and
hope
they
threatened
its
life
with
a
railway
share
they
charmed
it
with
smiles
and
soap
then
the
butcher
contrived
an
ingenious
plan
for
making
a
separate
sally
and
had
fixed
on
a
spot
unfrequented
by
man
a
dismal
and
desolate
valley
but
the
very
same
plan
to
the
beaver
occurred
it
had
chosen
the
very
same
place
yet
neither
betrayed
by
a
sign
or
a
word
the
disgust
that
appeared
in
his
face
each
thought
he
was
thinking
of
nothing
but
snark
and
the
glorious
work
of
the
day
and
each
tried
to
pretend
that
he
did
not
remark
that
the
other
was
going
that
way
but
the
valley
grew
narrow
and
narrower
still
and
the
evening
got
darker
and
colder
till
merely
from
nervousness
not
from
good
will
they
marched
along
shoulder
to
shoulder
then
a
scream
shrill
and
high
rent
the
shuddering
sky
and
they
knew
that
some
danger
was
near
the
beaver
turned
pale
to
the
tip
of
its
tail
and
even
the
butcher
felt
queer
he
thought
of
his
childhood
left
far
far
behind
that
blissful
and
innocent
state
the
sound
so
exactly
recalled
to
his
mind
a
pencil
that
squeaks
on
a
slate
tis
the
voice
of
the
jubjub
he
suddenly
cried
this
man
that
they
used
to
call
dunce
as
the
bellman
would
tell
you
he
added
with
pride
i
have
uttered
that
sentiment
once
tis
the
note
of
the
jubjub
keep
count
i
entreat
you
will
find
i
have
told
it
you
twice
tis
the
song
of
the
jubjub
the
proof
is
complete
if
only
ive
stated
it
thrice
the
beaver
had
counted
with
scrupulous
care
attending
to
every
word
but
it
fairly
lost
heart
and
outgrabe
in
despair
when
the
third
repetition
occurred
it
felt
that
in
spite
of
all
possible
pains
it
had
somehow
contrived
to
lose
count
and
the
only
thing
now
was
to
rack
its
poor
brains
by
reckoning
up
the
amount
two
added
to
one
if
that
could
but
be
done
it
said
with
ones
fingers
and
thumbs
recollecting
with
tears
how
in
earlier
years
it
had
taken
no
pains
with
its
sums
the
thing
can
be
done
said
the
butcher
i
think
the
thing
must
be
done
i
am
sure
the
thing
shall
be
done
bring
me
paper
and
ink
the
best
there
is
time
to
procure
the
beaver
brought
paper
portfolio
pens
and
ink
in
unfailing
supplies
while
strange
creepy
creatures
came
out
of
their
dens
and
watched
them
with
wondering
eyes
so
engrossed
was
the
butcher
he
heeded
them
not
as
he
wrote
with
a
pen
in
each
hand
and
explained
all
the
while
in
a
popular
style
which
the
beaver
could
well
understand
taking
three
as
the
subject
to
reason
about
a
convenient
number
to
state
we
add
seven
and
ten
and
then
multiply
out
by
one
thousand
diminished
by
eight
the
result
we
proceed
to
divide
as
you
see
by
nine
hundred
and
ninety
and
two
then
subtract
seventeen
and
the
answer
must
be
exactly
and
perfectly
true
the
method
employed
i
would
gladly
explain
while
i
have
it
so
clear
in
my
head
if
i
had
but
the
time
and
you
had
but
the
brain
but
much
yet
remains
to
be
said
in
one
moment
ive
seen
what
has
hitherto
been
enveloped
in
absolute
mystery
and
without
extra
charge
i
will
give
you
at
large
a
lesson
in
natural
history
in
his
genial
way
he
proceeded
to
say
forgetting
all
laws
of
propriety
and
that
giving
instruction
without
introduction
would
have
caused
quite
a
thrill
in
society
as
to
temper
the
jubjubs
a
desperate
bird
since
it
lives
in
perpetual
passion
its
taste
in
costume
is
entirely
absurd
it
is
ages
ahead
of
the
fashion
but
it
knows
any
friend
it
has
met
once
before
it
never
will
look
at
a
bribe
and
in
charity
meetings
it
stands
at
the
door
and
collects
though
it
does
not
subscribe
its
flavour
when
cooked
is
more
exquisite
far
than
mutton
or
oysters
or
eggs
some
think
it
keeps
best
in
an
ivory
jar
and
some
in
mahogany
kegs
you
boil
it
in
sawdust
you
salt
it
in
glue
you
condense
it
with
locusts
and
tape
still
keeping
one
principal
object
in
view
to
preserve
its
symmetrical
shape
the
butcher
would
gladly
have
talked
till
next
day
but
he
felt
that
the
lesson
must
end
and
he
wept
with
delight
in
attempting
to
say
he
considered
the
beaver
his
friend
while
the
beaver
confessed
with
affectionate
looks
more
eloquent
even
than
tears
it
had
learned
in
ten
minutes
far
more
than
all
books
would
have
taught
it
in
seventy
years
they
returned
hand
in
hand
and
the
bellman
unmanned
for
a
moment
with
noble
emotion
said
this
amply
repays
all
the
wearisome
days
we
have
spent
on
the
billowy
ocean
such
friends
as
the
beaver
and
butcher
became
have
seldom
if
ever
been
known
in
winter
or
summer
twas
always
the
same
you
could
never
meet
either
alone
and
when
quarrels
arose
as
one
frequently
finds
quarrels
will
spite
of
every
endeavour
the
song
of
the
jubjub
recurred
to
their
minds
and
cemented
their
friendship
for
ever
fit
the
sixth
the
barristers
dream
they
sought
it
with
thimbles
they
sought
it
with
care
they
pursued
it
with
forks
and
hope
they
threatened
its
life
with
a
railway
share
they
charmed
it
with
smiles
and
soap
but
the
barrister
weary
of
proving
in
vain
that
the
beavers
lace
making
was
wrong
fell
asleep
and
in
dreams
saw
the
creature
quite
plain
that
his
fancy
had
dwelt
on
so
long
he
dreamed
that
he
stood
in
a
shadowy
court
where
the
snark
with
a
glass
in
its
eye
dressed
in
gown
bands
and
wig
was
defending
a
pig
on
the
charge
of
deserting
its
sty
the
witnesses
proved
without
error
or
flaw
that
the
sty
was
deserted
when
found
and
the
judge
kept
explaining
the
state
of
the
law
in
a
soft
under
current
of
sound
the
indictment
had
never
been
clearly
expressed
and
it
seemed
that
the
snark
had
begun
and
had
spoken
three
hours
before
any
one
guessed
what
the
pig
was
supposed
to
have
done
the
jury
had
each
formed
a
different
view
long
before
the
indictment
was
read
and
they
all
spoke
at
once
so
that
none
of
them
knew
one
word
that
the
others
had
said
you
must
know
said
the
judge
but
the
snark
exclaimed
fudge
that
statute
is
obsolete
quite
let
me
tell
you
my
friends
the
whole
question
depends
on
an
ancient
manorial
right
in
the
matter
of
treason
the
pig
would
appear
to
have
aided
but
scarcely
abetted
while
the
charge
of
insolvency
fails
it
is
clear
if
you
grant
the
plea
never
indebted

the
fact
of
desertion
i
will
not
dispute
but
its
guilt
as
i
trust
is
removed
so
far
as
relates
to
the
costs
of
this
suit
by
the
alibi
which
has
been
proved
my
poor
clients
fate
now
depends
on
your
votes
here
the
speaker
sat
down
in
his
place
and
directed
the
judge
to
refer
to
his
notes
and
briefly
to
sum
up
the
case
but
the
judge
said
he
never
had
summed
up
before
so
the
snark
undertook
it
instead
and
summed
it
so
well
that
it
came
to
far
more
than
the
witnesses
ever
had
said
when
the
verdict
was
called
for
the
jury
declined
as
the
word
was
so
puzzling
to
spell
but
they
ventured
to
hope
that
the
snark
wouldnt
mind
undertaking
that
duty
as
well
so
the
snark
found
the
verdict
although
as
it
owned
it
was
spent
with
the
toils
of
the
day
when
it
said
the
word
guilty
the
jury
all
groaned
and
some
of
them
fainted
away
then
the
snark
pronounced
sentence
the
judge
being
quite
too
nervous
to
utter
a
word
when
it
rose
to
its
feet
there
was
silence
like
night
and
the
fall
of
a
pin
might
be
heard
transportation
for
life
was
the
sentence
it
gave
and
then
to
be
fined
forty
pound
the
jury
all
cheered
though
the
judge
said
he
feared
that
the
phrase
was
not
legally
sound
but
their
wild
exultation
was
suddenly
checked
when
the
jailer
informed
them
with
tears
such
a
sentence
would
have
not
the
slightest
effect
as
the
pig
had
been
dead
for
some
years
the
judge
left
the
court
looking
deeply
disgusted
but
the
snark
though
a
little
aghast
as
the
lawyer
to
whom
the
defence
was
intrusted
went
bellowing
on
to
the
last
thus
the
barrister
dreamed
while
the
bellowing
seemed
to
grow
every
moment
more
clear
till
he
woke
to
the
knell
of
a
furious
bell
which
the
bellman
rang
close
at
his
ear
fit
the
seventh
the
bankers
fate
they
sought
it
with
thimbles
they
sought
it
with
care
they
pursued
it
with
forks
and
hope
they
threatened
its
life
with
a
railway
share
they
charmed
it
with
smiles
and
soap
and
the
banker
inspired
with
a
courage
so
new
it
was
matter
for
general
remark
rushed
madly
ahead
and
was
lost
to
their
view
in
his
zeal
to
discover
the
snark
but
while
he
was
seeking
with
thimbles
and
care
a
bandersnatch
swiftly
drew
nigh
and
grabbed
at
the
banker
who
shrieked
in
despair
for
he
knew
it
was
useless
to
fly
he
offered
large
discount
he
offered
a
cheque
drawn
to
bearer
for
seven
pounds
ten
but
the
bandersnatch
merely
extended
its
neck
and
grabbed
at
the
banker
again
without
rest
or
pause
while
those
frumious
jaws
went
savagely
snapping
around
he
skipped
and
he
hopped
and
he
floundered
and
flopped
till
fainting
he
fell
to
the
ground
the
bandersnatch
fled
as
the
others
appeared
led
on
by
that
fear
stricken
yell
and
the
bellman
remarked
it
is
just
as
i
feared
and
solemnly
tolled
on
his
bell
he
was
black
in
the
face
and
they
scarcely
could
trace
the
least
likeness
to
what
he
had
been
while
so
great
was
his
fright
that
his
waistcoat
turned
white
a
wonderful
thing
to
be
seen
to
the
horror
of
all
who
were
present
that
day
he
uprose
in
full
evening
dress
and
with
senseless
grimaces
endeavoured
to
say
what
his
tongue
could
no
longer
express
down
he
sank
in
a
chair
ran
his
hands
through
his
hair
and
chanted
in
mimsiest
tones
words
whose
utter
inanity
proved
his
insanity
while
he
rattled
a
couple
of
bones
leave
him
here
to
his
fate
it
is
getting
so
late
the
bellman
exclaimed
in
a
fright
we
have
lost
half
the
day
any
further
delay
and
we
shant
catch
a
snark
before
night
fit
the
eighth
the
vanishing
they
sought
it
with
thimbles
they
sought
it
with
care
they
pursued
it
with
forks
and
hope
they
threatened
its
life
with
a
railway
share
they
charmed
it
with
smiles
and
soap
they
shuddered
to
think
that
the
chase
might
fail
and
the
beaver
excited
at
last
went
bounding
along
on
the
tip
of
its
tail
for
the
daylight
was
nearly
past
there
is
thingumbob
shouting
the
bellman
said
he
is
shouting
like
mad
only
hark
he
is
waving
his
hands
he
is
wagging
his
head
he
has
certainly
found
a
snark
they
gazed
in
delight
while
the
butcher
exclaimed
he
was
always
a
desperate
wag
they
beheld
him
their
baker
their
hero
unnamed
on
the
top
of
a
neighbouring
crag
erect
and
sublime
for
one
moment
of
time
in
the
next
that
wild
figure
they
saw
as
if
stung
by
a
spasm
plunge
into
a
chasm
while
they
waited
and
listened
in
awe
its
a
snark
was
the
sound
that
first
came
to
their
ears
and
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
then
followed
a
torrent
of
laughter
and
cheers
then
the
ominous
words
its
a
boo
then
silence
some
fancied
they
heard
in
the
air
a
weary
and
wandering
sigh
that
sounded
like
jum
but
the
others
declare
it
was
only
a
breeze
that
went
by
they
hunted
till
darkness
came
on
but
they
found
not
a
button
or
feather
or
mark
by
which
they
could
tell
that
they
stood
on
the
ground
where
the
baker
had
met
with
the
snark
in
the
midst
of
the
word
he
was
trying
to
say
in
the
midst
of
his
laughter
and
glee
he
had
softly
and
suddenly
vanished
away
for
the
snark
was
a
boojum
you
see
